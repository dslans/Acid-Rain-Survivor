# Acid-Rain-Survivor
Development materials of my first game/iOS app, Acid Rain: Survivor

This repository only includes the basic programming files needed for development on Xcode using the Swift language. Other features of the game, including artwork, sounds, music, etc. were also created by myself but are not uploaded to this repository.
